# keyboard-layout

[slide 1](slides/001.vpm)

This is a presentation about *keyboard layout - for the modern (programming) needs*.

I live in germany and have been using a German QWERTZ based Keyboard for a very long time (decades)
without a thought of changing it.

Why should I? As I said, I live in Germany, and therefore I need the German special Characters on my Keyboard.
On the other hand, the changed *Z* and *Y* characters have bothered me in the past when sthe system
sometimes switched to an English keyboard layout (usually when I installed a new Computer with a new OS).

## Motivation

[slide 2](slides/002.vpm)

During my entire working live in the IT industry, I've met a lot of crazy IT guys and seen a lot of
interesting Keyboards. A few times, for example, I've seen completely black keyboards with no
symbols printed on them (what the heck, why?!).  

A year ago I was talking with Martin, a colleague, about his used keyboard Layout. During our reviews
or pair programming, he said that he had to change the keyboard layout before he could give his
keyboard to me. He used a German keyboard like me, but with a different keyboard layout: Neo.

This was very impressive to me. He explained to me, that this Layout is optimized for programming.  

However, it was clear to me that I would never seriously think about changing my keyboard layout.
It seemed much too difficult and I am too stupid for something like that.

**IDE Shortcuts**

But more and more I noticed the strange key combinations which also bothered me a lot. On the one hand,
they were not ergonomic at all and consequently not quick and easy to reach.
On the other hand, some symbols were not present on my keyboard at all.

**Internet Videos and Blog Articles to use US QWRTY for programming**

The more I looked into the subject, the more often I got the statement that the US standard layout
(QWERTY) is more effective when it comes to IT (e.g. programming or shell navigation).

But why?

## History - Why is the keyboard as it is?

[slide 3](slides/003.vpm)

A keyboard was needed long time ago before the invention of the computer. When the Telegraph became
a printing Telegraph and the Typewriter came along. This point is about mechanical machines and as
a Funfact, in the beginning, people took things that they knew from the past, like a piano keyboard.

Especially for the Typewriter, the letters were arranged in such a way that there would be no jamming
of mechanical components when writing text.

That's why the QWERTY keyboard layout was invented. This has nothing to do with ergonomics or the
best arrangement of the letters to write text with as few finger movements as possible.
It has only to do with the needs of the machine, how it works best!

By the way, the first human-computer communication took place with a teletypewriter (printing telegraph),
which is called a terminal then.
As with communication with a regular teletype, control codes are also necessary - so the American
Standard Code for Information (ASCII) was invented for a terminal.

As you now know, this Keyboard Layout isn't static. Currently you can find the Window key as an example
on the most keyboards and many layouts have been added for national needs added - like the German
umlauts - where letters and symbols are rearrenged ('Y' / 'Z'), keys are added/deleted
('AltGr', Menu) and so on.

The headline of this slide does not refer to my success story, it's the headline of a YouTube video.

But if you also decide to change your keyboard layout like this YouTuber, only a few steps are necessary:

1. Learn the location of the keys. You need to know them by memory and should be able to write text
   without looking at the Keyboard.
2. Learn to access the positions of the keys without having to think about them. This is part of
   *muscle memory* like driving a car or riding a bicycle.

But this requires daily practice like a musician who has to work several hours to learn an instrument.
*The Internet* assumes half an hour to an hour and half of daily practice sessions.
You can also find many tools for practicing on the Internet, such as *TypeRacer*.

## Which Layout

[slide 5](slides/005.vpm)

There are a large number of different keyboard layouts that are more or less orientated towards QWERTY.
However, some layouts breaks free from the chains of the standard layout, which in the past was more
orientated towards mechanical needs.

They change the arrangement of symbols to improve typing speed specially for IT Issues - like
Neo - or in general - like Workman.

These mentioned layouts require a lot of learning. However, **changing from the national to the
US standard layout could be a small step for a programmer but a big leap for working ergonomically
with a keyboard**.

Thats my thought on this and my approach.

## Tweak for different Language Support

[slide 6](slides/006.vpm)

If you change the keyboard layout to a layout without national symbols, it doesn't mean that these
symbols are gone forever. There are several ways to add them - for example, by typing unicode shortcuts.

But in my opinion, the most flexible option is to reintroduce the *Compose key*. This key was
developed in the 80s for the UNIX/DEC environement and, by the way, an official symbol was designed
with it. The function behind isthat after pressing this key you, you press a sequence of other
further keys to trigger the insertion of an alternative character - `‚éÑ, ", a ‚Üí √§` as an example.

You can see from this example that the sequence is logical and plausible. There are many standarized
sequences given and it is also customizable.
This approach will enhance your typeset far more than, say, national - though not as convenient.

## Conclusion

[slide 7](slides/007.vpm)

After this information, I think it's worth thinking about leaving your comfort zone and trying out
a new optimized keyboard layout.

I was recently talking with Philipp, a colleague, about this topic and at this point that he was
noticeably blown away - something clicked in his head and he suddenly realized the benefits of it.

As a programmer you probably type more code or technical stuff
than write prosa (or emails) with the need for national language settings.

You should weigh this and the question of which keyboard layout is best for you.

The simplest option, wich increases ergonomic access to common characters or key combinations used
in an IT environment, with fewer rearranged letters, is to switch from national QWERTZ to US standard QWERTY.

Much more typing speed and ergonomics will be archived by changing the layout to Neo or Workman
(or anything like that). But the pain and learning curve will be much more... interesting üòâ
